La trahumancia El ciclo productivo es marcadamente estacional, con apareamientos en otoño y pariciones en primavera. Existen además prácicas culturales y sociales propias de los crianceros tales como las castronerías. Esta actividad ocupa hoy a más de 1200 familias de crianceros que, durante el período otoño-invernal utilizan áreas de pastoreo en zonas relativamente bajas, entre 880 m.s.n.m y los 1200 m.s.n.m, denominadas invernadas, que se caracterizan por la presencia de una vegetación de estepa graminosa-arbustiva. En época estival se trasladan a las veranadas, zonas de la cordillera que varían entre los 1200 m.s.n.m y los 2000 m.s.n.m pastoreando en áreas que durante el invierno se cubren de nieve (Lanari 2004). La conexión de éstos espacios de pastoreo se sostiene gracias a la existencia de caminos de arreo, espacios de uso comunitario que permiten conectar ambos ambientes (Bendini et al. 2011; Easdale 2012). Los arreos recorren distancias variables de pocas horas días hasta más de 30 días.",,"El ciclo productivo es de estacionalidad estricta en función de las condiciones climáticas, el uso de espacios de pastoreo y los momentos de comercialización. Los reproductores macho, denominados castrones o chivatos, se separan del resto del piño durante el período de verano para su cuidado en las castronerías (Moronta et al., 2017) para ser reintegrados al piño en los meses de abril o mayo durante la época de servicio.

"," El sistema tradicional está orientado a la producción de carne. Los chivitos de tres a seis meses de edad son comercializados en la región.

222,Argentina,ARG,Sheep,Linca,Español,"La Patagonia, es la principal zona de producción lanera de la Argentina, concentrándose en la misma el mayor stock ovino nacional (SENASA 2012). Dicha producción se sustenta a partir de la raza Merino la cual tiene un protagonismo casi exclusivo en la región. Sin embargo antes de las primeras introducciones al país de ejemplares Merino, los ovinos que habitaban la región eran utilizados como fuente de abrigo, alimento y trueque por los pueblos originarios locales, los cuales se comerciaban con todo tipo de productos desde y hacia Chile (Porcel de Peralta, 1965; Palermo, 1998; Mandrini, 1998; Bandieri, 2005). En el siglo XIX y tras la independencia del Virreinato del Río de la Plata de la corona española, se liberan las trabas comerciales existentes hasta el momento, por lo que la producción agropecuaria sufre un gran auge, favoreciendo a la producción lanera nacional y a la importación de animales de lana fina, codiciadas ambas por el mercado internacional (Giberti, 1961). Esto, sumado a la conquista de tierras anteriormente habitadas por los pueblos originarios, y al fomento por parte del gobierno para poblar la Patagonia, promueve el apogeo de la producción ovina, desencadenando un proceso conocido como “Merinización”. De esta manera la raza Merino fue imponiéndose, absorbiendo paulatinamente a las poblaciones ovinas pre-existentes (Arrazcaeta, 1998; Coronato, 2010). Hoy la raza Merino tiene un protagonismo casi exclusivo en la producción agropecuaria de la región, en tanto la Corriedale conforma los sistemas productivos de la provincia de Santa Cruz y Tierra del Fuego, quedando solo rezagos de las primeras poblaciones ovinas que la habitaron. Sin embargo a partir de trabajos realizados junto a artesanas de la región, se ha podido identificar que el tipo de lana más adecuada para el desarrollo de artesanías tradicionales en telar Mapuche difiere de aquella que demanda la industria. La misma proviene de animales “Criollos” conocidos regionalmente como “Linca”. La población “Linca” actual presenta majadas dispersas y reducidas, notándose dificultades en la reposición de hembras y particularmente de machos reproductores.",,,"Meat, Wool",,,,,,Se encuentran adaptadas a las condiciones de cirnaza extensivas imperantes en la Patagponia Norte de la Argentina.,,,,,,,"Las criadoras/es e hilanderas valoran la lana “Linca” por la presencia de doble cobertura, largo de mecha, suavidad y diversidad de colores.

Dichos animales utilizados tradicionalmente por los pueblos originarios, sufrieron desplazamiento y erosión por parte de razas especializadas en producción de lana fina para la industria.

Actualmente presenta majadas dispersas y reducidas, notándose dificultades en la reposición de hembras y particularmente de machos reproductores.

In addition, milking cows occasionally receive gruel, made of minced and boiled yak head and pig fat apart from concentrate fed during milking. Herders in Soey Yaksa also make hay out of wheat, oats and native grass grown in their limited area for feeding during winter. Turnips and radish are also stored as winter feed. This practice however is uncommon in other places.

Milk is sold locally/dairy as per situation and male calves / bullocks are sold and used for draught power in agricultural activities ,,,"In Bali, the animals migrate to the areas of the Aravalli hills adjoining to Bali tehsil. In Sirohi district the Raika community migrates along with their Nari herds in November/December every year to the Gujarat state due to unavailability of adequate feed and fodder. They cover about 200 km of distance during migration and finally stay in the places like Himatnagar, Idar, Kherbrahma (Sabarkantha district) or Dessa, Palanpur (Banaskantha district). The onward journey is completed in about 30 days. The community moves along with their families. During the migration, the luggage is carried over the donkeys/camels. Around 4 to 8 Raika individuals join together to make the herd of more than 500 and 8-10 donkeys are required to carry their luggage and kitchen items. The return journey is completed in 8-10 days, mostly after onset of rains i.e. July/August. The breeding method opted by farmers is natural mating. About 1 to 2 bulls are available in the herds depending on the size of herds. The young males started their first service at the age of 3.0-3.5 years of age and used for breeding up to the age of 10 years. Bullsare selected on the basis of criteria like milk production of the dam, physical characters and coat color.However, one bull is kept for a period of three years in a herd and thereafter it is rotated to other herd. ","Raika/Rabari of Sirohi and Pali districts are the breeders who evolved, maintained and conserves this majestic cattle breed.

Like the Kerry, they are descended from the predominately black cattle of the early Celts. The frequently heard theory that the Dexters are a comparatively new breed is a complete fallacy as the breed is fully described and mentioned by its proper name, in a report on Irish cattle written in 1845, by Mr David Low. From this publication we learn that the breed owes its modern appearance, name, and probably qualities to a Mr Dexter who was agent to a Lord Howarden who came to Ireland in 1750 and made his home in Co Tipperary. David Low stated that a Mr Dexter had produced his curious breed by selection from the best of the hardy mountain cattle of the area, and to have succeeded to a very high degree.  Dexter cattle were first introduced into England in 1882, when ten Dexters were purchased by Mr. Martin. J. Sutton of Kidmore Grange, Oxfordshire from Mr. James. Robertson of La Mancha, Nr Malahide, Dublin. They were first shown at the Royal Show at Norwich in 1886. By 1892, this native Irish breed was so well established in Great Britain that at a meeting of breeders at the Smithfield club on December 6th resulted in the formation of the Kerry and Dexter/Kerry cattle society.",1750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56.0,"Milk yields vary as to whether the cows are kept for dairy cows, sucklers or house cows. For instance, the average daily milk yield for a house cow will be some 8 - 10 litres (2450 - 3050 litres per 305 day lactation). A cow kept as a suckler will raise its own calf as well as a larger commercial calf and do them both well. Dexters kept as dairy cows will yield on average, 10 - 12 litres daily (3050 - 3660 litres per 305 day lactation), with some individuals yielding 14 litres or more (4080 litres per 305 day lactation). The milk is of very good quality with high butterfat (BF) and protein levels; average BF % is well over 4% and protein 3.51%.

7712,Ireland,IRL,Cattle,Kerry,eng.,"The Kerry cow is black, sometimes with a little white on the udder. The breed is of dairy type, well ribbed with fine bone. Females have slender white horns tipped with black, though most herds are now dehorned. They are equally suited to being one of a big herd or single house cows. The bull is similar in character to the cow. He is usually docile and easily managed.",Kerry,Kerry Cattle,Milk,,,"The cows enjoy a long useful life, still strong and calving regularly at 14 and 15 years of age. They are extremely hardy and will out winter quite happily, growing a good coat of hair which keeps the cold out. Their agility enables them to travel safely over rough ground and they do little damage to the pastures. Because of their size at least three Kerries can be kept to two of other breeds. The cows rarely have trouble calving, for there is more room in the pelvis than would appear from the size of the cow. The calves are easily reared and the bullocks will fatten, though they may take 4 to 6 months longer than other breeds. They make excellent quality beef weighing up to 550 kg. The globules of butterfat in Kerry milk are much smaller than those found in other breeds, thus making it easier to digest. As a result it is ideal for feeding to babies, invalids and others who find it hard to take fat. This emphasises the breed as eminently suitable for fresh milk, cheese and yogurt production. Several Irish farmhouse cheese makers use Kerry milk. The average milk yield is between 3000 and 3700kg at 4% butterfat. However there are quite a number of cows capable of yielding over 4500kg.",,,"The Kerry Cattle Society of Ireland was formed in 1917 to do all such things necessary to promote and maintain the purity of the breed. In 2002 the Society registered as a Co-Op and became The Kerry Cattle Society Ltd, in order to be better able to carry out its work. The Society now has membership in Ireland, Great Britain, USA and Canada.  Volume 1 of the herd book was published in 1890. The following quotation is taken from the preface to that volume.  In 1879 the County Kerry Agricultural Society passed a resolution approving of the publication of a Herd-book under their own auspices; but difficulties arose which prevented the project from being carried out.  The ""Farmers' Gazette"" undertook the publication of a Register, and in January, 1887, published the first issue of their ""Register of Pure Kerry Cattle and Dexters"". This Register extended to three volumes, including 46 Kerry Bulls and 100 Kerry Cows. It did not include any Dexter Bulls, and only 10 Dexter Cows. The Royal Dublin Society acquired from the publishers of the ""Farmers' Gazette"" their rights in connexion with this Register; and the Cattle, with the numbers originally assigned to them, are now included in the Society's Herd-book.  The Royal Dublin Society maintained the herd book until the end of 2001. It is now maintained by The Kerry Cattle Society Ltd, who are responsible for all registrations, issuing of herd book certificates and publishing the herd book.",,,,The breed is well adapted to live in the wet hilly country.,,, Milk and Meat,This is considered a hardy breed with low feeding requirements.,,,,Mountain,,,,,,,,,,uni coloured: black occasional with white marking on udder,,,2,2,"white horns tipped with black, lyre shaped upright",140.0,125.0,570.0,360.0,Native,y,1887,domestic,breed,"The Kerry is believed to be one of the oldest breeds in Europe. The skull is very similar in formation to the ancient aurochs of the Stone Age (Bos primogenus) though smaller in size. It is thought that the Kerry is derived from the little black cow, the Celtic shorthorn, brought by Neolithic man in his migrations northwards from the Mediterranean basin. There are close affinities with the Heren, the small black breed surviving in the high Alps, and with the fierce black bulls of the Camargue. The Kerry has the distinction of being the first breed developed primarily as a milk producer. While prehistoric man in Asia, North Africa and Europe was selecting and breeding cattle for draught and meat, the Celtic civilisation in Ireland was producing a breed of cattle for milk and dairy produce. The diet was based on milk and milk products; meat was rarely eaten. Records have been found which show that milk was preserved in various forms including cheese and butter. It was also treated with herbs and kept in jars under ground. With the mild climate and long grazing season milk was produced almost all year round",,since 1950 from Kerry (United Kingdom),"Kerry, South-western Ireland and some locations around the rest of the country",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,international,Not Sufficient,atRisk,critical,,endangered,,465.0,465000.0,,,,

The goats were purebred within their breed until 1979 when a buck of Gorno-Altai breed was used as an sire. This resulted in the goat producing more cashmere but the cashmere became longer and the diameter bigger. In 1985, there was an inspection and thus in 1986 an National breeding farm was established with about 17 thousand goats, 4 types of other animal. From 1986-1996 the herd was studied, every year анги, хувьс was segregated, main herd organized, buck and doe were selected accordingly adjusted under the supervision of Breed selection station, soum`s livestock specialist. Results from work done between 1986-1996 are as follow: 1. Adequate goat population was defined and thus a dark body coated goat herd that was adaptable mountainous steppe region with big body, high yield in cashmere was created and the bucks wore bred to be sold. 2.

But the red goat was almost purely reserved in Ulgii soum. Local herder have deemed white, tawny goats unnecessary for reproduction since their cashmere output low, had hair more than cashmere, were not able to withstand the harsh spring month, and had a lot of miscarriages. So, the herders have selectively bred the red goat which in time created the “Ulgiin red” strain goat. The herder had used only red bucks and by 1986, 56% of the goat herd had a red body coat.

Surviving herds of the Rinderpest plague of 1896-99 and the Boer War of 1899-1902 provided the foundation stock of the modern Africander breed.

10480,Netherlands,NLD,Horse,Fries Paard,dutch,"FPS is the Netherlands' oldest and second largest studbook and has about 12,000 members living in the Netherlands and abroad. At this time there are about 40,000 Friesian horses registered. The Friesian horse is a purebred horse native to the Netherlands. Its roots go far back in time. The Friesian horse was recognized as early as the 13th century, and Friesian horses of today still display definite similarities with their distant ancestors. The breed's long history and a consistent breeding policy have consolidated the specific 'Friesian' characteristics. On this sturdy foundation, the Friesian horse has evolved into what it is today: an imposing presence in every respect.  With its black colour, long mane and full tail, the Friesian is recognizable in an instant. The horse has an elegant build and powerful, elevated gaits. Its character is friendly and graciously spirited. All of these qualities make the Friesian a fine horse that can be used for many different purposes.  The Friesian horse is being successfully – and above all, very enthusiastically – employed in various equestrian sports. The specific Friesian qualities are displayed especially well in driving competitions where they can be seen in action before the gig, in the single horse and pairs classes as well as in the unicorn and show cart categories. Competing for the highest honours, these black horses are making themselves very well known.  The Friesian horse is also a fine dressage horse. Its fine self-carriage, willingness to work and inquisitive nature make it perfect for this branch of the sport. Friesians are now increasingly being seen at national competitions where they are displaying their talents to compete on equal terms with all other horses bred for riding purposes. Friesian horses are just as well represented in driving trials and marathon tests. And, last but certainly not least, one can scarcely imagine a more enjoyable partner as a recreational horse than the Friesian.  After the critical period in the 1960s, the tide has turned and the Friesian horse has done nothing but gain in popularity and appreciation. This year, the number of foals born was around 6000, and this number is increasing every year. These larger numbers are giving the FPS an opportunity to be stricter in its selections and in this way to bring the average quality of the horses' conformation and usefulness to a higher plane. In 2009 about 26000 animals in the Netherlands and about 7000 foals were born each year. In 2017 3656 foals were born.   Schurink, A.; Arts, J.A.J.; Ducro, B.J.

A mature ewe weighs 75 kilos on average and stands 68 centimetres at the withers. The Texel Sheep is a medium sized sheep, that lambs once a year. Adult ewes usually birth and suckle two lambs per litter. Ewes can have their first litter at 12 months. The Texel Sheep is of very good meat quality, with excellent fat deposition. A Texel Sheep is large-framed, has a solid square stance and looks bigger than its actual size. Its head is characteristic and well-proportioned with a straight nasal bridge and a wide mouth. The head is covered with fine white hair, in contrast to the black nose. Its neck is long and in proportion. The body has pronounced muscling with well-developed loins and thighs. The forehand, middle and hind quarters are evenly proportioned. The Texel Sheep’s forehand is broad and deep, with well-positioned and reasonably long shoulders and a breastbone extending sufficiently to the front. Its middle piece is long and broad with sufficient depth in the ribs and broad, strong loins. The hindquarters are broad, while the croup is long and lightly sloped. The legs have a delicate structure, are dry and powerful, and are positioned correctly when walking or standing. Its wool is fine, dense and doesn’t contain excess lanolin. The rump is covered in a white coat. Both head and legs aren’t covered with wool but with fine white hair. The tail is thin and of appropriate length.  HISTORY  Origins of the Texel Sheep  The Texel Sheep was bred over a hundred years ago as a crossbreed from indigenous marsh sheep and several British breeds, such as Leicester, Wensleydale and Lincoln. This resulted in a large, fast-growing and woolly sheep. Through effective selection, this breed of sheep has become the most heavily muscled meat sheep in the world. The Texel Sheep is a breed in which excellent carcass quality and great prolific qualities come together.  The Netherlands has a long history of sheep farming. Approximately 1.5 million sheep are kept on about 20,000 farms. Specialist sheep farms have over 300 ewes. Most sheep are held in dairy farms as a secondary activity, with ewes lambing in spring. Breeding, reproduction and meat farming is mainly integrated in the company’s activities. Sheep are mainly kept for meat production. The profitability of sheep farming is determined by lamb production, growth rate and meat quality.  Over the past few decades, sheep farmers have invested a lot of money in research on increasing the profitability of their businesses. By using rams with superior genetic traits, great progress has been made in further improving the functional exterior features and carcass composition. Where in the past the emphasis was on meat and wool production, the main goal of today is the sales of slaughter lambs of a consistent, high quality.",Texel sheep,,"Meat, SireLine",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lean carcasses, very good conformation/muscularity and good meat quality are reported for this breed. meat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"uni coloured: white, sometimes with black spots on ears.

It makes good use of all sorts of spontaneous, not being selective.",,,,,,,,,,,Red,,2,2,"White thin horns, dark on the edges, elliptical, hook-shaped, “acabanadaos” or in low lyre.",165.0,155.0,700.0,400.0,Native,y,1979,Domestic,Breed,"For Bernardo Lima (1873), a small ""alentejano"", well adapted to the hills of lean pastures and hard loads. Hard to carry and to plough in the hillsides and saws and producing the best ox of halter. It exists in Baixo Alentejo, in the lands of Mértola, Alcoutim and Martinlongo. As a halter ox it was taken to the care of wild cattle in the region of Ribatejo. It was a unicoloured Mertolengo, with a more “retinta” color, without meshes and with spiral horns. Professor Paula Nogueira (quoted by Isaías Vaz, 1987) states that in Baixo Alentejo, the oxen are less corpulent and in the region of Mértola, cut by the Guadiana, there is a variety called Mertolenga, composed of animals with little body and rather cherry or brown color, whose shapes make the transition of the Alentejo cattle to the Algarve cattle. Teófilo Frazão (1961), states that the real Mertolengo was that bovine adapted for its smallness and hardness to the rough, montuous, quite folded and scarce in forage lands of Mértola and Alcoutim, which coincided with the variety mentioned by B. Lima. Still for T. Frazão (1961), with the franchise of the border to the cattle of the two iberian countries, for around 1900, came between them, spotted cattle that, already in the neighboring country, had fame for rusticity and good nail for the campaign of wild cattle. Some were left on the left bank of the Guadiana, others went to the fairs of Garvão and Aljustrel and from there to Ribatejo. With the need for an energetic animal for the rice areas of the Tejo, Sado and Sorraia, since the Alentejano, Mirandesa and Brava breeds, due to their nature, did not meet the requirements, the Mertolenga breed's wild red phenotype appears, with a straight profile, high hooked horns and a feisty nature. Its origin is associated with the lands of Coruche, in the first decades of the 20th century, with interference from “flavor” Charnequeiro cattle and spotted Mertolengo cattle coming from Garvão, and from there it extended its area of dispersion to the valleys of other rivers (Frazão, 1961). From the explanations given by various scholars of the Mertolenga breed directly reflect the use of the original “alentejanado” Mertolengo and the imported “Baixo Guadiana” Mertolengo, the permanence of the genetically strong white colour, giving rise to the “rosilho mil-flores” Mertolengo (which added the “ruão” component of the Mertolenga breed of cattle) and which quickly, by the combination of partial advantages of the other two types, expanded throughout the region of Serpa and Évora, and had as a place of racial solidification the Herdade da Abóboda, due to the effort of several enthusiasts and connoisseurs, of which we highlight Dr. António José Borges Bettencourt, Prof. Nuno Maria Villas Boas Potes and Dr. Isaías Monteiro Vaz. The latter as Technical Secretary of the Breed, in a phase of national turbulence, achieved the great feat of standardizing, within its specificity, the three Mertolengo’s phenotypes.

Goat breeding was not appreciated, therefore, poor care and inbreeding were often present which was reflected in weak constitution, growth retardation and low milk yield. Disregardful of goat husbandry was a result from a number of grazing bans in the past. One of the radical ban was made by the Special Commission in Soca and in Trenta, 1873, which proposed the killing all of the goats. Prohibitions of goats grazing were related to the general opinion of their adverse impact on the forest. On the other hand it has gradually been felt that the systematic cutting of the forest is more harmful in comparison to goat grazing. Goat breeding was the most developed in Bovec and Tolmin area where natural conditions did not allow a high production.

JohnsonIn December, 1982, the Smithsonian magazine gave a well-written tribute, in the form of an article by Robert Wernick, to an animal that may well be Mans oldest friend, yet one that is much-maligned, even despised, in some areas of the world today, including many parts of this country. The goat--an attractive, affectionate and very useful small ruminant--has rendered uncomplaining service to mankind for many thousands of years in Mr. Wernicks words. Dairy goats have passed a peak in popularity in America, and indications are that this decade-long spate of enthusiasm is starting to wane. Angora goats, which produce mohair, remain big business, particularly in the Edwards Plateau area of Texas. However, the range and intensity of opinions and feelings about goats remains a source of astonishment. In America, goats can be roughly divided into four camps: (1) the Angora (and now including Cashmere) goats, whose owners view them as a business proposition and as producing units; (2) the dairy goats, whose owners are busily engaged at present in creating another class of pedigreed, registered, show animal, with milk production a more secondary factor--a circumstance due in part to many states restrictions on the promotion and sale of raw milk; (3) the miniature (African Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf) goats, which make very intelligent, responsive and affectionate pets, and (4) the great unsung world of the scrub, brush common, or woods goats--(the nomenclature depending on the locale)--the folk who keep goats of no particular ancestral distinction to clear land, as meat animals, and/or because they just like having them around. Curiously, though all these groups are dealing with breed variants of the same animal, there is for the most part very little communication between the groups; in some cases, actual antagonism. Couple this with the generally poor PR that has been the lot of the American goat from the founding of this country, and it is little wonder that the goat is often depicted as a tin-can-eating, destructive animal fit only for the veriest backwaters of civilization.It was not always so; indeed, goats supply milk and meat to a larger percentage of the worlds population than do all other farm animals combined. Mans involvement with goats over countless millenia has, as with other types of livestock, resulted in the evolution of a great variety of goat breeds worldwide. Just as many breeds of other livestock are in danger of becoming extinct, so it is with goats, many breeds of which have lost their original habitats and/or spheres of usefulness in the face of encroaching 20th-century technology and burgeoning populations. Many breeds today are falling victim to upgrading schemes; local goats in many third-world countries are being crossbred to improved dairy breeds exported from England, Switzerland, France, Canada, Australia, and the U.S.A. The risk of losing many native breeds is very real, and yet even the basic taxonomy of the goat family is, to date, an issue widely debated. Goats and sheep are classified in the Family Bovidae, Subfamily Caprinae, Tribe Caprini; the Genus Capra is reserved for true goats. In his valuable work Lords of the Pinnacles: Wild Goats of the World, Raul Valdez recognizes the following species of wild goats:Capra aegagrus - the Beozar goat or pasangCapra ibex - the Ibexes, with 4 subspeciesCapra caucasica - the west Caucasian turCapra cylindricornis - the east Caucasian turCapra falconeri - the markhors, with 4 subspeciesCapra pyrenaica - the Spanish wild goats, with 3 subspeciesIn his extremely useful and readable work Mountain Monarchs: Wild Sheep and Goats of the Himalaya, George Shaller, basically agreeing with Valdez species list, notes the custom of classifying the domestic goat as Capra hircus, and discusses its still-unproven origins. Capra aegagrus is thought to be the ancestor of the domestic goat, though there remains the possibility that C. falconeri, cylindricornis and/or caucasica may have been included. Seven species are easy enough to commit to memory; but when we consider breeds worldwide, the task of making sense out of the nomenclature becomes herculean, and the number and variety is quite astonishing.A lengthy book would hardly do the subject justice, and this is a bit beyond the scope of the animal magazines. However, as a point of departure for those interested in pursuing the subject, I append the following list of goat breeds. This is offered only as a check-list of breed names, with very brief commentary. Close scrutiny may reveal that some of these names may overlap. Since the list has been taken from a number of sources, including the first work devoted solely to goats, La Chevre by M. Joseph Crepin (Paris, 1903) breeds may be included that have already been lost. Additions and/or additional information would be welcomed.In this country the following goat breeds are extant:(1) The mohair goats--represented by the Angora and Cashmere goats., and novelty crosses including the Pygora, and Nigora,(2) The dairy goats--Alpines, LaManchas, Nubians, Oberhasli, Saanens, Sables, British Toggenburgs and Toggenburgs.(3) The novelty goats--the African Pygmy, Nigerian Dwarf, and the Fainting goat or Tennessee Wooden-leg. Crosses to create new breeds exist, such as the Kinder goat, and the Dwarf Alpine. Also, Ibexes, Ibex crosses, Tur, and Markhors are to be found in zoos and on game farms.(4) The meat and brush goats--the native woods goat, the recently-imported Boer goat, and the Spanish goat.In addition, a number of other crosses have been tried, even a patented breed, the NuAlpine. Most such crosses are the work of single or a few breeders, and they have not been given separate breed names. Such is the case abroad also; though a number of goat breeds owe their origins to deliberate and long-continued crossing.

It goes without saying that the same rationales that apply to the preservation of rare breeds of other types of livestock apply also to goats. Some of these breeds have been studied intensively in their native countries, and many possess qualities that certainly merit preservation. With the possibility of international shipment of frozen embryos in the near future, the importation and establishment of more breeds in this country could become a reality; and the splashy, showy Schwartzhals, the lovely Golden Gurensey and Murciana, the striking Girgentana, the docile, hardy Mambrine and Appenzeller, and many others, could grace American barns and pastures and--who can now say--contribute to the improvement of American goats.The writer has been collecting anything he could locate in print on goats, toward the building of, hopefully, the definitive library and bibliography on Mans oldest friend. He would welcome correspondence with anyone interested in goat literature, and/or who may know of sources of old goat periodicals, research papers, books, articles, etc. as well as anyone who may have additions, corrections, and/or supplemental information to the goat breeds check-list.

However, the range and intensity of opinions and feelings about goats remains a source of astonishment. In America, goats can be roughly divided into four camps: (1) the Angora (and now including Cashmere) goats, whose owners view them as a business proposition and as producing units; (2) the dairy goats, whose owners are busily engaged at present in creating another class of pedigreed, registered, show animal, with milk production a more secondary factor--a circumstance due in part to many states restrictions on the promotion and sale of raw milk; (3) the miniature (African Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf) goats, which make very intelligent, responsive and affectionate pets, and (4) the great unsung world of the scrub, brush common, or woods goats--(the nomenclature depending on the locale)--the folk who keep goats of no particular ancestral distinction to clear land, as meat animals, and/or because they just like having them around. Curiously, though all these groups are dealing with breed variants of the same animal, there is for the most part very little communication between the groups; in some cases, actual antagonism. Couple this with the generally poor PR that has been the lot of the American goat from the founding of this country, and it is little wonder that the goat is often depicted as a tin-can-eating, destructive animal fit only for the veriest backwaters of civilization.It was not always so; indeed, goats supply milk and meat to a larger percentage of the worlds population than do all other farm animals combined. Mans involvement with goats over countless millenia has, as with other types of livestock, resulted in the evolution of a great variety of goat breeds worldwide. Just as many breeds of other livestock are in danger of becoming extinct, so it is with goats, many breeds of which have lost their original habitats and/or spheres of usefulness in the face of encroaching 20th-century technology and burgeoning populations. Many breeds today are falling victim to upgrading schemes; local goats in many third-world countries are being crossbred to improved dairy breeds exported from England, Switzerland, France, Canada, Australia, and the U.S.A. The risk of losing many native breeds is very real, and yet even the basic taxonomy of the goat family is, to date, an issue widely debated. Goats and sheep are classified in the Family Bovidae, Subfamily Caprinae, Tribe Caprini; the Genus Capra is reserved for true goats. In his valuable work Lords of the Pinnacles: Wild Goats of the World, Raul Valdez recognizes the following species of wild goats:Capra aegagrus - the Beozar goat or pasangCapra ibex - the Ibexes, with 4 subspeciesCapra caucasica - the west Caucasian turCapra cylindricornis - the east Caucasian turCapra falconeri - the markhors, with 4 subspeciesCapra pyrenaica - the Spanish wild goats, with 3 subspeciesIn his extremely useful and readable work Mountain Monarchs: Wild Sheep and Goats of the Himalaya, George Shaller, basically agreeing with Valdez species list, notes the custom of classifying the domestic goat as Capra hircus, and discusses its still-unproven origins. Capra aegagrus is thought to be the ancestor of the domestic goat, though there remains the possibility that C. falconeri, cylindricornis and/or caucasica may have been included. Seven species are easy enough to commit to memory; but when we consider breeds worldwide, the task of making sense out of the nomenclature becomes herculean, and the number and variety is quite astonishing.A lengthy book would hardly do the subject justice, and this is a bit beyond the scope of the animal magazines. However, as a point of departure for those interested in pursuing the subject, I append the following list of goat breeds. This is offered only as a check-list of breed names, with very brief commentary. Close scrutiny may reveal that some of these names may overlap. Since the list has been taken from a number of sources, including the first work devoted solely to goats, La Chevre by M. Joseph Crepin (Paris, 1903) breeds may be included that have already been lost. Additions and/or additional information would be welcomed.In this country the following goat breeds are extant:(1) The mohair goats--represented by the Angora and Cashmere goats., and novelty crosses including the Pygora, and Nigora,(2) The dairy goats--Alpines, LaManchas, Nubians, Oberhasli, Saanens, Sables, British Toggenburgs and Toggenburgs.(3) The novelty goats--the African Pygmy, Nigerian Dwarf, and the Fainting goat or Tennessee Wooden-leg. Crosses to create new breeds exist, such as the Kinder goat, and the Dwarf Alpine. Also, Ibexes, Ibex crosses, Tur, and Markhors are to be found in zoos and on game farms.(4) The meat and brush goats--the native woods goat, the recently-imported Boer goat, and the Spanish goat.In addition, a number of other crosses have been tried, even a patented breed, the NuAlpine. Most such crosses are the work of single or a few breeders, and they have not been given separate breed names. Such is the case abroad also; though a number of goat breeds owe their origins to deliberate and long-continued crossing. Here is our check-list of goat breeds of the world, as described in the literature to date:Abkhasian North east TurkeyAbyssinian Nubian type; reddish-brownAgrigento SicilyAkyat Jaffa, Ceylon; of Burmese originAlbanian two varieties; a large mountain type, gray or brown, and a smaller plains variety with corkscrew hornsAnatolian Black TurkeyAnglo-Nubian British; from a blend of the old English goat with the Zaraibi, Chitral and Jamna Pari; the ori gin of the Nubian goat of AmericaAngora Originated in Asia; now worldwide in distribution; produces mohairAppenzell Switzerland; a white Toggenburg, long-coatedAsmari Afghanistan.

Josef Heintz had crossed a Japanese Harlequin buck to a common gray-checkered doe. One of the bucks out of the litter, was the first “Rhinelander,” having the desirable orange and black marking on the chin, ears, and butterfly markings – the spots on one side of the rabbit being all orange and on the other side all black. Heintz then mated a Harlequin buck to a Checkered Giant doe, which produced a desirable doe in the resulting litter. Using the buck and doe thus produced, he proceeded to breed – keeping the best does and mating them back to Japanese bucks. He succeeded in producing the Rhinelander, and in 1905 the breed was given a standard in Germany.",The Livestock Conservancy provided text and photos.,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white body with black and orange markings, markings are evenly distributed on the body, the spine is marked with a line starting at the nape and ending at the tail, ears are colored with black and orange markings from the tips to the base, the eyes are circled by orange and black markings, eyes are chestnut brown",,,,,,,,3.6,3.8,,n,,domestic,breed,originated in Germany in 1902; imported to America in 1923; imported to America in 1972;,1902,since 1923 from Rhinelander (Germany) since 1972 from Rhinelander (Germany),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,local,No Information,atRisk,critical,,,,3.7,3700.0,,,,

It is likely that Garland used self-colored Checkered Giants for the very large size; Champagne D’Argents for the silvering, fur length, and meat qualities; and perhaps an infusion of American Blue to improve on the meat producing qualities and the blue color.

Characteristically, they: - were neck-humped - had a small stature - were rounded in appearance with sloping rumps - had sleek and shiny coats - were fine bone structured - had small, broad and alert heads - had long, thin active tails - had horns in cows which curved outwards and forwards, and were round and fine in cross-section - had horns in bulls which were also rounded but shorter and heavier, curving out and upwards - had horns in oxen which were longer and more widespread - were predominantly black in colour, followed by reds and browns, with yellows and duns being less common - had coat colours were often accompanied by white patches or stipples very broken in outline - frequently had black and red colour mixing giving rise to variations of attractive M’Sundu pattern or more rarely brindle (Nhuru) ",Mashona,"Amanjanja, Makaranga, Ngombe Dza Vakaranga, Shona, Ngombe Dza Maswina","Carting, DraughtPower, SavingSecurity",,,,,,• Long lifetime and high productivity • High fertility • Early maturity • Consistent high calving percentage under hash conditions • Excellent mothering ability • Low calving difficulties,,,,survive under harsh conditions,heat telerant,high fertility, ,This breed is known for a good survivability.,"Mrs. S.
